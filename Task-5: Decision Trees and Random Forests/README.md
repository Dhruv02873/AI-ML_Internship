# AI-ML Internship Task-5: Decision Trees and Random Forests

## Objective
Learn tree-based models for classification & regression.

## Dataset
[Heart Disease Dataset]
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/johnsmith88/heart-disease-datase

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- graphviz (for tree visualization)

## Steps
1.Train a Decision Tree Classifier and visualize the tree.
2.Analyze overfitting and control tree depth.
3.Train a Random Forest and compare accuracy.
4.Interpret feature importances.
5.Evaluate using cross-validation.

## Key Insights from the Data[Inferences]
- Decision Tree classifier
- Random Forest ensemble
- Overfitting control with depth
- Feature importance analysis
- Cross-validation accuracy

## Files Included
- `main.py` – The main Python script for this task
- `Output/` – A folder containing all the output generated.


## How to Run This Project
1.  Make sure the  dataset file is in the same folder.

2. Install required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn```
3. Run the script:

   ```bash
   python main.py```
